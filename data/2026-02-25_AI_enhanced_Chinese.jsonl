Recent work has demonstrated a fully CPU-less approach to executing functional programs, by exploiting their inherent parallelisability to compile them directly into parallel digital logic. This work uses lambda-calculus as a hyper simple functional language to prove the concept, but is impractical for real-world programming due to the well-known inefficiencies of pure lambda$-calculus. It is common in language design to extend basic lambda-calculus with additional primitives to short-cut common tasks such as arithmetic and lists. In this work, we build upon our previous research to examine how such extensions may be applied to CPU-less functional execution in digital logic, with the objective of advancing the approach toward practical implementation. We present a set of structures and algorithms for representing new primitives, describe a systematic process for selecting, implementing, and evaluating them, and demonstrate substantial reductions in execution time and node usage. These improvements are implemented in an open-source system, which is shown to correctly evaluate a range of representative lambda expressions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
