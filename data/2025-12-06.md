Abstract: In this work, we present FLEX, an FPGA-CPU accelerator for mixed-cell-height legalization tasks. We address challenges from the following perspectives. First, we optimize the task assignment strategy and perform an efficient task partition between FPGA and CPU to exploit their complementary strengths. Second, a multi-granularity pipelining technique is employed to accelerate the most time-consuming step, finding optimal placement position (FOP), in legalization. At last, we particularly target the computationally intensive cell shifting process in FOP, optimizing the design to align it seamlessly with the multi-granularity pipelining framework for further speedup. Experimental results show that FLEX achieves up to 18.3x and 5.4x speedups compared to state-of-the-art CPU-GPU and multi-threaded CPU legalizers with better scalability, while improving legalization quality by 4% and 1%.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to ensuring functional stability of neural networks through hardware redundancy at the individual neuron level. Unlike the classical Dropout method, which is used during training for regularization purposes, the proposed system ensures resilience to hardware failures during network operation. Each neuron is implemented on a separate microcomputer (ESP32), allowing the system to continue functioning even when individual computational nodes fail.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to automated stripboard circuit layout design using Answer Set Programming (ASP). The work formulates the layout problem as both a synthesis and multi-objective optimization task that simultaneously generates viable layouts while minimizing board area and component strip crossing. By leveraging ASP's declarative nature, this work expresses complex geometric and electrical constraints in a natural and concise manner. The two-phase solving methodology first ensures feasibility before optimizing layout quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach generates compact, manufacturable layouts for a range of circuit complexities. This work represents a significant advancement in automated stripboard layout, offering a practical tool for electronics prototyping and education while showcasing the power of declarative programming for solving complex design automation problems.
