Abstract: This paper presents SimulatorCoder, an agent powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to generate and optimize deep neural network (DNN) accelerator simulators based on natural language descriptions. By integrating domain-specific prompt engineering including In-Context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and a multi-round feedback-verification flow, SimulatorCoder systematically transforms high-level functional requirements into efficient, executable, and architecture-aligned simulator code. Experiments based on the customized SCALE-Sim benchmark demonstrate that structured prompting and feedback mechanisms substantially improve both code generation accuracy and simulator performance. The resulting simulators not only maintain cycle-level fidelity with less than 1% error compared to manually implemented counterparts, but also consistently achieve lower simulation runtimes, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in accelerating simulator development. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiayuhuan/SimulatorCoder.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on standard digital logic and Boolean reasoning tasks, yet their reliability under locally redefined semantics remains poorly understood. In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains.
