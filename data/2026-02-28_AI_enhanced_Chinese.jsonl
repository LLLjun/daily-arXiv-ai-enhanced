While custom ASIC accelerators can mitigate these costs, their long time-to-market and the rapid evolution of FHE algorithms threaten their long-term relevance. GPUs, by contrast, offer scalability, programmability, and widespread availability, making them an attractive platform for FHE. However, modern GPUs are increasingly specialized for machine learning workloads, emphasizing low-precision datatypes (e.g., INT$8$, FP$8$) that are fundamentally mismatched to the wide-precision modulo arithmetic required by FHE. Essentially, while GPUs offer ample parallelism, their functional units, like Tensor Cores, are not suited for wide-integer modulo arithmetic required by FHE schemes such as CKKS. Despite this constraint, researchers have attempted to map FHE primitives on Tensor Cores by segmenting wide integers into low-precision (INT$8$) chunks.\n  To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose FHECore, a specialized functional unit integrated directly into the GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor. Our design is motivated by a key insight: the two dominant contributors to latency$-$Number Theoretic Transform and Base Conversion$-$can be formulated as modulo-linear transformations. This allows them to be mapped on a common hardware unit that natively supports wide-precision modulo-multiply-accumulate operations. Our simulations demonstrate that FHECore reduces dynamic instruction count by a geometric mean of $2.41\\times$ for CKKS primitives and $1.96\\times$ for end-to-end workloads. These reductions translate to performance speedups of $1.57\\times$ and $2.12\\times$, respectively$-$including a $50\\%$ reduction in bootstrapping latency$-$all while inuring a modest $2.4\\%$ area overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
