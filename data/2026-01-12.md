Abstract: Several interconnection networks are based on the complete graph topology. Networks with a moderate size can be based on a single complete graph. However, large-scale networks such as Dragonfly and HyperX use, respectively, a hierarchical or a multi-dimensional composition of complete graphs.
  The number of links in these networks is huge and grows rapidly with their size. This paper introduces LACIN, a set of complete graph implementations that use identically indexed ports to link switches. This way of implementing the network reduces the complexity of its cabling and its routing. LACIN eases the deployment of networks for parallel computers of different scales, from VLSI systems to the largest supercomputers.
