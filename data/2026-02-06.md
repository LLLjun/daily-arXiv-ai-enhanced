Abstract: The discrepancy between processor speed and memory system performance continues to limit the performance of many workloads. To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness. For example, SPP is a popular prefetcher that leverages confidence throttled recursion to speculate on the future path of program's references, however it is very susceptible to the reference reordering of higher-level caches and the OoO core. Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric. Targeting the second-level cache, SPPAM alongside state-of-the-art prefetchers Berti and Bingo improve system performance by 31.4% over no prefetching and 6.2% over the baseline of Berti and Pythia.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but incur high memory and computation costs. Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.
