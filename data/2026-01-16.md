Abstract: Processing in Memory (PIM) and similar terms such as Compute In Memory (CIM), Logic in Memory (LIM), In Memory Computing (IMC), and Near Memory Computing (NMC) have gained attention recently as a potentially ``revolutionary new'' technique. The truth, however, is that many examples of the technology go back over 60 years. This document attempts to provide an annotated bibliography of PIM technology that attempts to cover the whole time-frame, and is organized to augment a forth-coming article.
