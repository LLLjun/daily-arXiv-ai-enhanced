To address this trade-off, this paper introduces a digital stochastic CIM (DS-CIM) architecture that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. We implement signed multiply-accumulation (MAC) in a compact, unsigned OR-based circuit by modifying the data representation. Throughput is enhanced by replicating this low-cost circuit 64 times with only a 1x area increase. Our core strategy, a shared Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) with 2D partitioning, enables single-cycle mutually exclusive activation to eliminate OR-gate collisions. We also resolve the 1s saturation issue via stochastic process analysis and data remapping, significantly improving accuracy and resilience to input sparsity. Our high-accuracy DS-CIM1 variant achieves 94.45% accuracy for INT8 ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of just 0.74%. Meanwhile, our high-efficiency DS-CIM2 variant attains an energy efficiency of 3566.1 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 363.7 TOPS/mm^2, while maintaining a low RMSE of 3.81%. The DS-CIM capability with larger models is further demonstrated through experiments with INT8 ResNet50 on ImageNet and the FP8 LLaMA-7B model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
