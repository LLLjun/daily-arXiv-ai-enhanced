While custom ASIC accelerators can mitigate these costs, their long time-to-market and the rapid evolution of FHE algorithms threaten their long-term relevance. GPUs, by contrast, offer scalability, programmability, and widespread availability, making them an attractive platform for FHE. However, modern GPUs are increasingly specialized for machine learning workloads, emphasizing low-precision datatypes (e.g., INT$8$, FP$8$) that are fundamentally mismatched to the wide-precision modulo arithmetic required by FHE. Essentially, while GPUs offer ample parallelism, their functional units, like Tensor Cores, are not suited for wide-integer modulo arithmetic required by FHE schemes such as CKKS. Despite this constraint, researchers have attempted to map FHE primitives on Tensor Cores by segmenting wide integers into low-precision (INT$8$) chunks.\n  To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose FHECore, a specialized functional unit integrated directly into the GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor. Our design is motivated by a key insight: the two dominant contributors to latency$-$Number Theoretic Transform and Base Conversion$-$can be formulated as modulo-linear transformations. This allows them to be mapped on a common hardware unit that natively supports wide-precision modulo-multiply-accumulate operations. Our simulations demonstrate that FHECore reduces dynamic instruction count by a geometric mean of $2.41\\times$ for CKKS primitives and $1.96\\times$ for end-to-end workloads. These reductions translate to performance speedups of $1.57\\times$ and $2.12\\times$, respectively$-$including a $50\\%$ reduction in bootstrapping latency$-$all while inuring a modest $2.4\\%$ area overhead."}

Classic multi-threshold activation hardware requires 2^n thresholds for n-bit outputs, causing a rapid increase in hardware cost as precision increases. We propose a reconfigurable activation hardware, GRAU, based on piecewise linear fitting, where the segment slopes are approximated by powers of two. Our design requires only basic comparators and 1-bit right shifters, supporting mixed-precision quantization and nonlinear functions such as SiLU. Compared with multi-threshold activators, GRAU reduces LUT consumption by over 90%, achieving higher hardware efficiency, flexibility, and scalability."}

Accepted by TACAS 2026", "summary": "Progress in hardware model checking depends critically on high-quality benchmarks. However, the community faces a significant benchmark gap: existing suites are limited in number, often distributed only in representations such as BTOR2 without access to the originating register-transfer-level (RTL) designs, and biased toward extreme difficulty where instances are either trivial or intractable. These limitations hinder rigorous evaluation of new verification techniques and encourage overfitting of solver heuristics to a narrow set of problems. To address this, we introduce EvolveGen, a framework for generating hardware model checking benchmarks by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with high-level synthesis (HLS). Our approach operates at an algorithmic level of abstraction in which an RL agent learns to construct computation graphs. By compiling these graphs under different synthesis directives, we produce pairs of functionally equivalent but structurally distinct hardware designs, inducing challenging model checking instances. Solver runtime is used as the reward signal, enabling the agent to autonomously discover and generate small-but-hard instances that expose solver-specific weaknesses. Experiments show that EvolveGen efficiently creates a diverse benchmark set in standard formats (e.g., AIGER and BTOR2) and effectively reveals performance bottlenecks in state-of-the-art model checkers."}

However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz)."}
