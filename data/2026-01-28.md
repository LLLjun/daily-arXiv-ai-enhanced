Abstract: Prefetching and off-chip prediction are two techniques proposed to hide long memory access latencies in high-performance processors. In this work, we demonstrate that: (1) prefetching and off-chip prediction often provide complementary performance benefits, yet (2) naively combining them often fails to realize their full performance potential, and (3) existing prefetcher control policies leave significant room for performance improvement behind.
  Our goal is to design a holistic framework that can autonomously learn to coordinate an off-chip predictor with multiple prefetchers employed at various cache levels. To this end, we propose a new technique called Athena, which models the coordination between prefetchers and off-chip predictor (OCP) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Athena acts as the RL agent that observes multiple system-level features (e.g., prefetcher/OCP accuracy, bandwidth usage) over an epoch of program execution, and uses them as state information to select a coordination action (i.e., enabling the prefetcher and/or OCP, and adjusting prefetcher aggressiveness). At the end of every epoch, Athena receives a numerical reward that measures the change in multiple system-level metrics (e.g., number of cycles taken to execute an epoch). Athena uses this reward to autonomously and continuously learn a policy to coordinate prefetchers with OCP.
  Our extensive evaluation using a diverse set of memory-intensive workloads shows that Athena consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art coordination policies across a wide range of system configurations with various combinations of underlying prefetchers, OCPs, and main memory bandwidths, while incurring only modest storage overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Solid-state drives (SSDs) are well suited for near-data processing (NDP) because they: (1) store large application datasets, and (2) support three NDP paradigms: in-storage processing (ISP), processing using DRAM in the SSD (PuD-SSD), and in-flash processing (IFP). A large body of prior SSD-based NDP techniques operate in isolation, mapping computations to only one or two NDP paradigms (i.e., ISP, PuD-SSD, or IFP) within the SSD. These techniques (1) are tailored to specific workloads or kernels, (2) do not exploit the full computational potential of an SSD, and (3) lack programmer-transparency. While several prior works propose techniques to partition computation between the host and near-memory accelerators, adapting these techniques to SSDs has limited benefits because they (1) ignore the heterogeneity of the SSD resources, and (2) make offloading decisions based on limited factors such as bandwidth utilization, or data movement cost. We propose Conduit, a general-purpose, programmer-transparent NDP framework for SSDs that leverages multiple SSD computation resources. At compile time, Conduit executes a custom compiler (e.g., LLVM) pass that (i) vectorizes suitable application code segments into SIMD operations that align with the SSD's page layout, and (ii) embeds metadata (e.g., operation type, operand sizes) into the vectorized instructions to guide runtime offloading decisions. At runtime, within the SSD, Conduit performs instruction-granularity offloading by evaluating six key features, and uses a cost function to select the most suitable SSD resource. We evaluate Conduit and two prior NDP offloading techniques using an in-house event-driven SSD simulator on six data-intensive workloads. Conduit outperforms the best-performing prior offloading policy by 1.8x and reduces energy consumption by 46%.

Abstract: Large-scale ML accelerators rely on large numbers of PEs, imposing strict bounds on the area and energy budget of each PE. Prior work demonstrates that limited dual-issue capabilities can be efficiently integrated into a lightweight in-order open-source RISC-V core (Snitch), with a geomean IPC boost of 1.6x and a geomean energy efficiency gain of 1.3x, obtained by concurrently executing integer and FP instructions. Unfortunately, this required a complex and error-prone low level programming model (COPIFT). We introduce COPIFTv2 which augments Snitch with lightweight queues enabling direct, fine-grained communication and synchronization between integer and FP threads. By eliminating the tiling and software pipelining steps of COPIFT, we can remove much of its complexity and software overheads. As a result, COPIFTv2 achieves up to a 1.49x speedup and a 1.47x energy-efficiency gain over COPIFT, and a peak IPC of 1.81. Overall, COPIFTv2 significantly enhances the efficiency and programmability of dual-issue execution on lightweight cores. Our implementation is fully open source and performance experiments are reproducible using free software.

Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a well-known algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, the computation time of SA increases rapidly, as the size of the problem grows. Recently, a stochastic simulated annealing (SSA) algorithm that converges faster than conventional SA has been reported. In this paper, we present a hardware-aware SSA (HA- SSA) algorithm for memory-efficient FPGA implementations. HA-SSA can reduce the memory usage of storing intermediate results while maintaining the computing speed of SSA. For evaluation purposes, the proposed algorithm is compared with the conventional SSA and SA approaches on maximum cut combinatorial optimization problems. HA-SSA achieves a convergence speed that is up to 114-times faster than that of the conventional SA algorithm depending on the maximum cut problem selected from the G-set which is a dataset of the maximum cut problems. HA-SSA is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) (Xilinx Kintex-7), and it achieves up to 6-times the memory efficiency of conventional SSA while maintaining high solution quality for optimization problems.

Abstract: As an emerging type of AI computing accelerator, SRAM Computing-In-Memory (CIM) accelerators feature high energy efficiency and throughput. However, various CIM designs and under-explored mapping strategies impede the full exploration of compute and storage balancing in SRAM-CIM accelerator, potentially leading to significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose CIM-Tuner, an automatic tool for hardware balancing and optimal mapping strategy under area constraint via hardware-mapping co-exploration. It ensures universality across various CIM designs through a matrix abstraction of CIM macros and a generalized accelerator template. For efficient mapping with different hardware configurations, it employs fine-grained two-level strategies comprising accelerator-level scheduling and macro-level tiling. Compared to prior CIM mapping, CIM-Tuner's extended strategy space achieves 1.58$\times$ higher energy efficiency and 2.11$\times$ higher throughput. Applied to SOTA CIM accelerators with identical area budget, CIM-Tuner also delivers comparable improvements. The simulation accuracy is silicon-verified and CIM-Tuner tool is open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/CIM-Tuner.git.

Abstract: RTL simulation on CPUs remains a persistent bottleneck in hardware design. State-of-the-art simulators embed the circuit directly into the simulation binary, resulting in long compilation times and execution that is fundamentally CPU frontend-bound, with severe instruction-cache pressure.
  This work proposes RTeAAL Sim, which reformulates RTL simulation as a sparse tensor algebra problem. By representing RTL circuits as tensors and simulation as a sparse tensor algebra kernel, RTeAAL Sim decouples simulation behavior from binary size and makes RTL simulation amenable to well-studied tensor algebra optimizations. We demonstrate that a prototype of our tensor-based simulator, even with a subset of these optimizations, already mitigates the compilation overhead and frontend pressure and achieves performance competitive with the highly optimized Verilator simulator across multiple CPUs and ISAs.

Abstract: The growing demand for compute-intensive applications has made multi-chiplet architectures a promising alternative to monolithic designs, offering improved scalability and manufacturing flexibility. However, effectively managing the economic effectiveness remains challenging. Existing cost models either overlook the amortization of compute value over a chip's operational lifetime or fail to evaluate how redundancy strategies, which are widely adopted to enhance yield and fault tolerance, impact long-term cost efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive cost-effectiveness framework for multi-chiplet architectures, introducing a novel Lifecycle Cost Effectiveness (LCE) metric that evaluates amortized compute costs by jointly optimizing manufacturing expenses and operational lifetime. Our approach uniquely integrates: (1) redundancy-aware cost modeling spanning both intra- and inter-chiplet levels, (2) reliability-driven lifetime estimation, and (3) quantitative analysis of how redundancy configurations on overall economic effectiveness. Extensive trade-off and multi-objective optimization studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and reveal essential co-optimization strategies between module and chiplet-level redundancy to achieve cost-efficient multi-chiplet architecture designs.
